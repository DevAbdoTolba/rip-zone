# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-22)

**Core value:** The interactive muscle map must work — users can see which muscles are strained, click any muscle for training guidance, and understand their body's state at a glance.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 8 (Foundation)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-22 — Roadmap created, 26 requirements mapped across 8 phases

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Pre-phase]: Use @svgr/webpack to import muscle map SVG as React component for per-path color manipulation
- [Pre-phase]: MongoDB for reference data only; Zustand + Dexie for all user data (no server-side user state in v1)
- [Pre-phase]: Derive strain state from raw workout logs at read time — never persist computed percentages

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 2 blocker]: SVG asset sourcing unresolved — commission, marketplace, or build from scratch. Decision needed before or during Phase 2 planning. This is the single most likely schedule blocker.
- [Phase 2 risk]: SVGR + Turbopack compatibility unconfirmed. Spike recommended in Phase 1 or early Phase 2.
- [Phase 7 risk]: Tier threshold calibration requires user testing iteration, not upfront research.
